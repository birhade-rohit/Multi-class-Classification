# Multi-class-Classification

General problem statement:
The task is to classify different scenarios (classes) based on data from multiple sensors in a node. The
classification task needs to be done in Python. You are free to use any classification method you would
like. The work should show what steps did you take to design model and train. How did you test your
design? It is important to show you work. For example, how did you improve your results as you went
along? How did you choose your design, features etc. It is okay to read techniques from open sources as
long and provide references (encouraged). It is okay to use “existing” design.
Data set description:
The dataset is created using 3 sensor data from 6 nodes under 5 different scenarios. Data for each
scenario from multiple nodes is organized in separate folders. Each node has data from 3 sensors
sampled a several time intervals. In practice, you have access to finite set of data at a time due to
memory limitations. Each folder has multiple files where each file represent data collected from a node.
